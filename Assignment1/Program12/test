 in the /dev/fd directory are rarely used within programs. Their most com-
mon use is in the shell. Many user-level commands take filename arguments, and
sometimes we would like to put them in a pipeline and have one of the arguments
be standard input or output instead. For this purpose, some programs (e.g., diff, ed,
tar, and comm) have evolved the hack of using an argument consisting of a single
hyphen ( - ) to mean “use standard input or output (as appropriate) for this file-
name argument.” Thus, to compare a file list from ls against a previously built file
list, we might write the following:
