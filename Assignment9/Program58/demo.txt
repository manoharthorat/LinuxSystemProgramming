I unsafely removed a usb device that was attached to loop0 with losetup and could not delete nor detach loop0 afterwards.
losetup -a shows /dev/loop0: [0005]:145606719 (/dev/sdb1)
When I remount the device to /dev/sdb1, umount it and try losetup -d /dev/loop0, I will still get the same error loop: can't delete device /dev/loop0: Device or resource busy. Are there any ways to get rid of the loop device?

That's odd, you don't usually attach loop to usb devices. How did you do that? – Keith May 4 '11 at 9:15
   	 
	
I was using LUKS encryption and thought I could encrypt my 1gb usb flash drive. – BiX May 5 '11 at 1:30
   	 
	
You can use LUKS for that, but not by using loop device. A LUKS partition has its own partition type. – Keith May 5 '11 at 2:37
   	 
	
Sorry noobness on my part, cannot find any clear instructions online. – BiX May 5 '11 at 3:20

are you sure, that the device isn't busy? Have you ever tried fuser to determine an possible PID? Precautionary get all possible informations:

fuser -c /dev/loop0
fuser -d /dev/loop0
fuser -f /dev/loop0

try to stop the process, which could use /dev/loop0 if necessary use kill -9 or: try fuser -k to send the kill signal -> look at man fuser

You may have to also use dmsetup to remove the device mapping. Easiest way, if it doesn't interfere with any other mappings is to use a dmsetup remove_all.

This worked for me, though I used dmsetup info to get the mappings, then used dmsetup remove <device>. Thank you. – Mark Mann Aug 7 '13 at 20:17
   	 
	
sudo dmsetup info gives me No devices found – Jayen Feb 12 '14 at 23:21

This also worked for me. For some reason using kpartx -a and then kpartx -d on CentOS 6.5 doesn't remove the mappings like it should. – Peter Jul 18 '14 at 6:35

I had a similar issue with an SD card and Aaoron Flin's suggestion to use dmsetup worked for me.

Specifically, you should be able to ls /dev/mapper to see if any loop0pX partitions exist.

If so, you can use dmsetup remove /dev/mapper/loop0p2 to get rid of any unnecessary partitions. This can be useful if you want to keep some mappings attached.

Try reloading the loop kernel module, if it does not help then reboot.

If you're using Luks, you need to luksClose first

cryptsetup luksClose $whatever
losetup -D

Definitely there is a process using it. If you couldn't determine which process is preventing it from deleting, then restart your server if you can.

Had the same issue today and none of the answers above fixed it (I didn't try to reload the loop kernel module because I wanted to understand the actual issue)

Turns out the image file associated with the loop device contained an "Linux LVM" partition, which was automatically set as shown by pvscan :

$ pvscan
  PV /dev/sda1    VG server-vg   lvm2 [417,76 GiB / 0  free]
  PV /dev/loop0   VG vbox-vg     lvm2 [7,81 GiB / 0    free]
  Total: 2 [425,57 GiB] / in use: 2 [425,57 GiB] / in no VG: 0 [0   ]

So I had de deactivate all the Logical Volume inside the Volume Group :

$ vgchange --activate n vbox-vg
  0 logical volume(s) in volume group "vbox-vg" now active

Eventually I was able to nicely detach the loop device :

$ losetup -d /dev/loop0
$ losetup -a
$
