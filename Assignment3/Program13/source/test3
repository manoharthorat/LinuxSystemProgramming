For your own functions, you should emulate the 'system'. There will be a header that declares the function, the source file that implements it, and the other source files that use the function. The other source files use the header to get the declaration correct. The implementation file includes the header to make sure its implementation is consistent with what the other source files expect. So the header is the glue that holds it all together.For your own functions, you should emulate the 'system'.
