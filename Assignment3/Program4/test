Each of these functions returns information about a file. stat( ) returns information
about the file denoted by the path, path, while fstat( ) returns information about
the file represented by the file descriptor fd . lstat( ) is identical to stat( ) , except
that in the case of a symbolic link, lstat( ) returns information about the link itself
and not the target file.
Each of these functions stores information in a stat structure, which is provided by
the user. The stat structure is defined in <bits/stat.h> , which is included from
<sys/stat.h> :
struct stat {
dev_t st_dev;
ino_t st_ino;
mode_t st_mode;
nlink_t st_nlink;
uid_t st_uid;
gid_t st_gid;
dev_t st_rdev;
off_t st_size;
blksize_t st_blksize;
blkcnt_t st_blocks;
time_t st_atime;
time_t st_mtime;
time_t st_ctime;
